An unofficial, open-source launcher for [Minecraft Java](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc) that provides profile isolation, seamless profile sharing with other players, and installing mods with ease.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in its early stages and not yet ready for general use. For updates and progress, see [#1 Kraft Launcher progress](https://github.com/KraftLauncher/kraft-launcher/issues/1). **Breaking changes** are likely to be introduced at this point, which means your data will be lost once the launcher is released.

**Kraft Launcher is not affiliated
with [Mojang](https://mojang.com/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), or any of their
subsidiaries.**

## üìñ About

**Kraft Launcher** addresses the same issue as [Kraft Sync](https://github.com/FreshKernel/kraft-sync) for sharing and syncing profiles (AKA instances). Due to limitations of the previous approach, a custom Minecraft launcher was developed to automate steps for a more user-friendly experience.

Our goal is to support standard features across most launchers while enabling players to share profiles with others. This includes mods, resource packs, data packs, shaders, configs, key binds, and more, all kept in sync with automatic updates.
