An unofficial, open-source launcher for [Minecraft Java](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/store/minecraft-java-bedrock-edition-pc) that provides profile isolation, seamless profile sharing with other players, and installing mods with ease.

> [!NOTE]
> This project is in its early stages and not yet ready for general use. For updates and progress, see [#1](https://github.com/EchoEllet/kraft-launcher/issues/1).

**Kraft Launcher is not affiliated
with [Mojang](https://mojang.com/), [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/), or any of their
subsidiaries.**

## üìñ About

**Kraft Launcher** addresses the same issue as [Kraft Sync](https://github.com/FreshKernel/kraft-sync) for sharing and syncing profiles (AKA instances). Due to limitations of the previous approach, a custom Minecraft launcher was developed to automate steps for a more user-friendly experience.

Our goal is to support standard features across most launchers while enabling players to share profiles with others. This includes mods, resource packs, data packs, shaders, configs, key binds, and more, all kept in sync with automatic updates.

## ‚ú® Features

* üîÑ **Account Switching**: Seamlessly switch between multiple Microsoft accounts.
* üìÅ **Profile Isolation**: Each profile has its own data ‚Äî separate mods, worlds, configs, and more.
* üîó **Profile Sharing & Syncing**: Effortlessly share complete profiles with others, including mods, resource packs, configs, key binds, Java version, Minecraft version, mod loader versions, and more.
* üîß **Customizable Syncing**: Choose which mods, resource packs, and configurations to sync, or exclude specific ones for a more personalized experience.
* üóÇÔ∏è **Profile Groups**: Organize your profiles using custom categories or labels.
* ‚òï **Built-in Java Installer**: Automatically installs the right Java version per profile, cross-platform.
* üì¶ **Modrinth + CurseForge Integration**: Install, update, and manage mods from both platforms.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Crash-Resistant**: View, copy, and share logs easily. Optionally upload to [mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/) or similar services.
* üì• **Import from Other Launchers**: Bring your instances and files from MultiMC or other launchers.
* üì∞ **News Feed**: Get the latest Minecraft news right in the launcher.
* üé® **Modern UI**: Clean interface built with [Material Design 3](https://m3.material.io/), supporting dark/light themes, dynamic colors, and custom accents.
* ‚ö° **Quick Play**: Automatically join a Minecraft server, world, or realm on launch.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Currently, the project doesn't implement most of these features yet, they were added early in `README` as they are planned in [#1](https://github.com/EchoEllet/kraft-launcher/issues/1), once they are available, this note will be removed.
